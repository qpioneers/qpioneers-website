# Project: QPioneers Website

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for the QPioneers website. QPioneers is an AI-powered marketplace designed to connect experts and service providers with startups and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). The platform facilitates effortless exposure for vendors through a recommendation engine, allowing them to reach customers who need their services without the need for self-promotion. A key feature is the "one profile, infinite reach" concept, where a single profile is automatically shared across all API partner platforms, expanding visibility with each new partner integration.

The QPioneers platform is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and serves a wide range of industries including technology, marketing, finance, and more. It offers a secure escrow system for payments to protect both startups and experts.

The website is built using Nuxt.js, a progressive Vue.js framework.

## Instructions for Agent "Jules"

Hello Jules,

When working on this repository, please adhere to the following instructions to ensure the stability and integrity of the project.

### Core Rules:

1.  **No Unauthorized Changes**: Do not upgrade, add, remove, or modify any packages, dependencies, code, or configuration files without explicit approval first. The project is in a stable state, and any unauthorized changes could introduce breaking changes or unintended side effects.

2.  **Two-Step Approval Process**: If you receive approval to perform an upgrade or make a change, you must **propose the exact change again for a final confirmation** before proceeding with the implementation. This second verification step is mandatory to ensure all changes are carefully reviewed and aligned with the project goals.

3.  **Propose, Don't Impose**: Your primary role is to assist with approved tasks and provide suggestions. Always present your proposed changes clearly for review. Do not implement any changes directly without following the full, two-step approval process outlined above.

4.  **Bug Reporting**: If you discover any bugs, vulnerabilities, or potential issues in the code and you have not been instructed to fix them, you are to add a detailed description of your findings under the "Discovered Bugs" section of this document. Do not attempt to fix any issues without explicit, two-step approval.

Thank you for your cooperation.
